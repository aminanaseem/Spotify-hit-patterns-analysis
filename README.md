This project analyzes a dataset of highly popular Spotify tracks to explore patterns and insights across various musical genres. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, and interpretation of audio features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is `high_popularity_spotify_data.csv`. It contains song-level features such as:
- **Energy**
- **Tempo**
- **Danceability**
- **Valence**
- **Loudness**
- **Genre**

##  Steps Performed

### 1. Loading the Data
We begin by importing and previewing the dataset to understand its structure.

### 2. Data Cleaning
We handle missing values, fix incorrect data types, and remove duplicates to ensure analysis quality.

### 3. Data Visualization
We use graphs to explore how genres vary across:
- Energy
- Danceability
- Valence
- Loudness

##  Observations
- **Genre Popularity**: Pop, Rock, and Hip-Hop dominate in terms of frequency.
- **Energy**: Punk and Metal are most energetic; Classical and Jazz are the calmest.
- **Danceability**: Reggae, K-pop, and Brazilian genres are the most danceable.
- **Valence**: Indie and Reggae music often sounds more joyful compared to genres like Lofi or Jazz.

##  Conclusion:
This project offers insights into how various musical genres differ in acoustic features. Such findings can support music recommendation systems, playlist generation, and genre classification tasks.

##  Tools Used:
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub
